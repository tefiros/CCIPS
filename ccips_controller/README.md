# ccips-controller
Pilot 3 CCIPS controller component

Â© Mattin Antartiko Elorza Forcada

The CCIPS controller is developed in go using the [`go-netconf-client`](https://github.com/openshift-telco/go-netconf-client) library.

- **Responses:**
- `200 OK`: Tunnel created successfully with details.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: An error occurred while creating the tunnel.

---

### **2. Get IPsec Tunnel Status**
- **Endpoint:** `/ccips/{uuid}`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Summary:** Retrieve the status of an IPsec tunnel.
- **Description:** Fetches the current status of the IPsec tunnel identified by its UUID.
- **Path Parameters:**
- `uuid` (string, required): The unique identifier of the IPsec tunnel.

## How to launch
If you are running the CCIPS Controller, directly using the code, you need to first install golang using the instructions from [here](https://go.dev/doc/install).

Then inside the directory of the CCIPS Controller run 
```bash!
go mod tidy
```
This will automatically download all the needed dependencies.

To launch the controller you can go to the folder `./cmd/server/` and run the following command
```bash!
go run main.go
```
It will prompt the following message `INFO: 2023/10/23 15:24:19 main.go:12: HTTP server started`
### Docker version
First build the controller
```bash
docker build -t ccips_controller .
```
To run it, by default it runs at port 5000, so you can run the docker image as follows:
```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 5000:5000 ccips_controller
```

It will prompt the following message `INFO: 2025/04/09 09:24:19 main.go:12: HTTP server started`

# Requests for the controller:

* Nodes: Information of the nodes with the following:
    - ipData: IP with which the other agent is going to see it and the one it is going to use to raise the tunnel.
    - ipControl: IP that it has in the control network.
    - ipDMZ: Agent's private IP. (G2G)
    - networkInternal: Private subnet. (G2G)
* encAlg: Algorithm used by the tunnel to encrypt. supports:
    - des
    - 3des
    - aes
* intAlg: Algorithm used by the tunnel to check the integrity of the packets. supports:
     - hmac-md5-96
     - hmac-md5-128
     - hmac-sha1-96
     - hmac-sha1-160
     - hmac-sha2-256
* softLifeTime: Time for initialising the rekey process.
* hardLifeTime: Time in which if the rekey has not been performed, it throws the ipsec link.
